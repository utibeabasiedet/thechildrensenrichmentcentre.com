	“It is easier to build strong children than broken Adults” - Frederick Douglas
	At the Children’s Enrichment Center, we believe that it takes a village to raise a whole child. <br>
	 <br> <b>Our mission</b>	 is to partner with parents in raising children who are physically, mentally, emotionally and socially developed and are fully aware of their gifts and potentials, in order to use them in serving the world.
	In our school, we believe in developing a whole child that is why we have developed a very special evening after school club which has a robust curriculum for children from the age of 5 to 10 years.
	<br> <b>Our vision</b>  is to become a global brand by redefining preschool experiences for growing minds and to become pace setters when it comes to child growth and development.
	<br> <b>Education:</b>  In the early years, education is important in setting a solid foundation for their life long journey ahead of them. Here, at the Children’s Enrichment Center, we have a child centered approach which treats every child under our care as a unique individual.
	<br> <b>Care:</b>  We support children from 18 months to 6 years. We offer high quality care and early years’ education where parents are our partners. We offer the best care to children so parents can have peace when they are away from their kids.
	 <br> <b>Values:</b>	 We have 5 core values which includes; excellence, integrity, commitment, respect and Fun.
	<br> <b>Curriculum:</b>  Our curriculum is built in a way that supports; Personal, social and emotional development.
	<br> <b>Physical development;</b>  development of fine and gross motor skills. <br>
	<br> <b>Language:</b>	 Listening and attention, receptive language development, expressive language. <br>
	<br> <b>Cognition:</b>   This include reasoning, memory, problem solving and thinking skills. These areas are developed through all the activities we carry out in our center. <br>
	<br> <b>Expressive arts and designs:</b>  exploring and using different materials to stimulate their imagination.
	<br> <b>Mathematics:</b>  Numbers, shapes, colors, geometry, time concept, space and measures. <br>
	Literacy development: Reading and writing.
	Learning and fun: We adopt a hands –on learning through music and movement, daily reading program, sensory integration etc.
	Our team members are passionate and committed to our core values and beliefs. <br>
	Why our program? 
	We are committed to our core values. We have a child first approach. High quality learning. The best foundation for success in life. Parental support and partnership. Safe, clean, nurturing and enriching environment in your absence.
